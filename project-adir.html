							<p>Created a virtual network using Oracle VirtualBox, Windows client and server in order to be familiarized with Active Directory, in-depth hands-on networking and be able to utilize this network for defense and pintesting. </p>
							<p>I started by creating the virtual network using Oracle VirtualBox with a Windows 10 ISO, Server 2019 ISO being two VMs and 1k fictional users. I then set up a VM as the Domain Controller (Server 2019) with 2 network adapters external internet and internal network. Additionally assigned Internal IP Addressing, configure NAT/Routing and setup DHCP & Active Directory. I used PowerShell to create over 1k fictional users for AD. Then using another VM created a client with Windows 10 connecting it with one network adapter connected to the internal network.</p>

									<p>I started with setting up a virtual machine through Oracle VirtualBox. This first machine acted as my main Domain Controller, DHCP Server, Active Directory and a Gateway for the internal network and any other machines. The Domain Controller loaded with Windows 2019 Server was setup with 2 NIC, one External and one Internal network. Assigned IP & Subnets, DNS Server. I then setup Active Directory utilzing a roote "mytestdomain." Created new OU in AD for dedicated Admin Login and created a Admin profile under this new OU. Additionally added a "User" OU for users to be loaded into later. Installed RAS/NAT to allow future Client to access internet through DC. Setup DHCP Server on DC to allow the client to obtain an IP address to access internet; during this also setup DHCP scope. I then utilized a simple PowerShell script to add ~1000 randomly generated users under the Users OU with some normalized configurations (first initial/lastname for username, default password (initially) etc). I then created a second VM, utilizing this as the 'Client' aka User. I loaded this profile with Windows 10 Pro ISO, setup only 1 NIC (Internal) to be gated through the DC for internet connections. After setting up the second machine, I double checked the IP/Gateway IPs to confirm the connections were valid. I used command line to confirm I was able to ping Google. I then switched back to the DC VM where I was able to confirm the Client machine was now connected through AD Computers as well as through DHCP>Address Leases were showing for the client IP. In the future I plan to utilize this VM network for testing, defense hardning and further exploration.</p>
